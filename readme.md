## TWTactics ##

**TWTactics** is a Windows desktop application for Tribal Wars that allows users to use an interactive graphical map of their world to plan attacks, monitor enemy progress and more.

### Getting started ###

The first beta release for the 'general public' can (probably) be expected somewhere end July 2014.

### Building the source ###
The entire program should compile in one go in both VisualStudio 2010 and 2012.

Should you get **Access to the registry key '...' is denied when opening the WinForms designer**, then restart VisualStudio as Administrator.  
`(TODO: Check if starting as Admin is only required the first time)` 

### Contributing ###

Contributing is not only possible but the main reason the project is here on GitHub. It's probably a good idea to contact me first before implementing any major new features though.
