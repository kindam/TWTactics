## TWTactics ##

**TWTactics** is a Windows desktop application for Tribal Wars that allows users to use an interactive graphical map of their world to plan attacks, monitor enemy progress and more.

### Building the source ###
Due to a dependency on the Janus WinForms suite, you need to start Visual Studio as Administrator if you want to open a form in design mode. 

The error you get is: **Access to the registry key '...' is denied** whenever you try to open the WinForms designer.

### Contributing ###

Contributing is not only possible but the main reason the project is hosted here on GitHub. It's probably a good idea to contact me before implementing any major new features though.
